          <h3>Full Stack Software Developer</h3>
          <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57234427?type=promoted#sol=283a4f18fa6f09e8bd34b0c320543d84212795fe">Ideal Job Listing on Seek</a>
          <p>This role is for a Full Stack Software Engineer who will be responsible for creating and maintaining software for an electric vehicle company. The role involves overseeing the full life-cycle of the software, allowing greater control over the end product. This role appeals to me for a number of reasons. </p>
          <p>Full Stack Developers generally have experience and skills that encompass a broad range of software development. This includes front-end and back-end development. Understanding the entirety of a subject or at least, understanding the context of a subject has always been very important to me. Knowing only one aspect of the development process I feel would severely hinder my own development and growth.</p>
          <p>This role entails creating software to help develop the electrical vehicle industry. This is a relatively new and growing industry which means there is a lot of room for innovation and creative solutions. Furthermore, the focus on environmental stability is exceptionally important when it comes to my personal decision-making. The field of IT is wide and varied, and my personal choices will always involve looking for businesses and companies that follow more ethical approaches for a more sustainable future.</p>
          <p>This role is for a Senior position, and thus is something to work towards during my education and career. In order to work in full-stack development you need to be competent in both front-end and back-end development.  For this position in particular, it requires intimate knowledge of various programming languages and server development technologies. Experience in database management is crucial as well as experience working in cloud environments. Front-end development is a large part of the role, thus experience with different front-end technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript, as well as third-party technologies is important. The end product is something that will be used by consumers, therefore UX design and overall graphic design knowledge is also needed.</p>
          <p>This is a lot. This type of job means learning multiple roles, and using them holistically to create an end design. My current experience with these technologies is severely limited. I am only just now learning my first programming language. Therefore, to progress towards this role will take an extensive amount of work as well as self-directed learning.</p>
          <p>This will involve figuring out exactly what I want to learn. Which languages will be most useful whilst developing my career? Python, which I am currently learning is a good start. C++, Ruby, JavaScript are all valuable languages to know and understand. However, this field is constantly evolving, so learning a few languages will not be enough to maintain a career, I will also need to be constantly updating my own knowledge and learning new languages and technologies as they become more commonplace.</p>
          <p>I currently have absolutely no knowledge as to how database technologies work. Relying solely on my course work to be comfortable with different technologies will be almost impossible. I will need to be constantly attempting my own projects using skills I have learned to garner greater understanding. Overall, my plan to one day be in a position where I could comfortably apply for this job is to never stop learning. I need to build a solid foundation of technical skills and knowledge in front-end and back-end development, and then never stop expanding these skills and using them in actual projects. </p>
