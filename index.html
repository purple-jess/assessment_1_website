          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
          <p>I was born in the United Kingdom to South African parents before moving
             to New Zealand, then Australia. Having had a somewhat transient
             upbringing, I was always interested in the differences you can find
             between cultures that can have far-reaching impacts.</p>

          <p>This interest initially drew me to the field of humanities and the study
            of society. I studied at a university level for a few years mainly in
            public relations, linguistics, and sociology. Although the content was
            very interesting, I found that I didnâ€™t see a future for myself in academia,
            which tends to be the main career path. Furthermore, the field of public
            relations left me grappling with my own ethical boundaries. </p>

            <p>During my years of study, I have mainly worked in the field of hospitality.
              I fully believe that this has given me a massive advantage, as I have
              worked with people from so many aspects of life in difficult and stressful
              situations. Overall, I still have a deep fascination with the inner
              machinations of society and what affects it.</p>
