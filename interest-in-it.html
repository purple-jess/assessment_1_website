          <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
          <p>My first interest in IT was relatively forced. My father worked in the field, and we always had technology around the house. However, because my father understood technology to an advanced degree, he often built his own solutions to problems, or had more technical ways of doing things. The simplest solution was never the one used in our household, only the best one. Unfortunately, understanding the technology he had put in place and using it was a rather steep learning curve. Enter Google.</p>
          <p>Inherent stubbornness or actual interest? Whenever I came across an error, or an issue with technology, it became almost a game to try and understand it. Not only how to fix the issue, but what had caused it in the first place. What can I do to make sure it doesn’t happen again?  Nearly everything I have learned about IT has been divined through sheer hyper focusing, as I fall further down the rabbit hole trying to frantically understand the why. </p>
          <p>Information technology is something that really shines, because in humanities understanding the why of something can be quite complicated. There are not only no easy answers, but there is direct conflict between reasoning from different parties. There is logic in technology. You just have to learn it, and understand it in order to draw conclusions. Of course, this is impacted by the human element of technology. At the end of the day, a person created a program or app. And you must understand their framework of thinking to understand their logic. This is what has always interested me about IT. Multiple people will do the same thing but in completely different ways.</p>
          <p>I chose RMIT quite simply because it seemed like the best option that worked within my already hectic life. It allowed a quick start and online learning that was flexible. The breakdown of the courses and majors was also extremely important. How much actual practical experience would I gain. Theoretical knowledge is all but useless without a way to use it. Of course, RMIT’s reputation as a university also played a part, particularly its history of graduates being able to enter the workforce with valuable skills and experience.</p>
          <p>During my studies at RMIT, I hope to learn not just how to do things, but why things are done certain ways. If I wanted to learn a programming language, there are plenty of free courses available that would have been simple. Instead, having the opportunity to use what I have been taught and implement them through structured learning is invaluable. Furthermore, IT is an everchanging field. There are so many different skills and languages you must know for different roles, and this is evolving constantly. I’m hoping this course will give me a good foundation to build upon in the future.</p>
