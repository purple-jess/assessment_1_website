              <h3>Myer Briggs Test</h3>
              <h4>INFP-T - Mediator</h4>

              <p>INFP’s, or Mediators, can be categorised as creative, idealistic, empathetic and individualistic. People who fall within this category tend to have strong values and are highly empathetic. INFP’s are often drawn to creative pursuits that align with their values to feel fulfilled.</p>
              <img src="images\myer-briggs.png" alt="myer-briggs-result">
              <h5>Strengths and Weaknesses</h5>
              <p>INFP’s are most categorised by their ability to empathise with others. This leads to a larger ability to work with different types of people and maintain relationships. Also known as a Mediator, INFP’s are able to understand people’s motivations and feelings. On the other hand, this emotional sensitivity also leads to greater vulnerability. People with this personality type can be influenced by other’s emotions and take criticism personally. This can also lead to self-criticism and ignoring one’s own needs over others.</p>
              <p>Another strength of INFP’s is their strong sense of ideals. Mediators tend to feel passionate about their beliefs and are often drawn to careers that adhere to their own morality over more pragmatic choices. This has a downside in that it is difficult to work on things that they are not passionate about. INFP’s may feel unfulfilled if they do not have connection to the work they are doing. Furthermore, INFP’s tend to hold themselves and others to unrealistic standards. It can be difficult to match up to what an INFP thinks a person should be, even for them.</p>
              <p>Finally, INFP’s tend to fall on the creative spectrum. They tend to look at problems in unorthodox ways and come up with creative solutions. They tend to be interested in fields that allow creativity and individual expression. Unfortunately, this ability to think imaginatively can also hinder their focus. It can be difficult for people with the INFP personality to commit to ideas, or settle on simple ways of doing things. </p>
              <p>This personality type certainly resonates with my own understanding of myself. Although inherently a flawed system, this broad categorisation of my personality has articulated aspects of myself that I could not do so before. In particular, my own need to adhere to my values and connect with others. It is easier to focus on the complimentary parts of this personality type, however I have definitely struggled throughout life from lacking purpose and having high emotional sensitivity. This result gives me a frame of reference to understand how I can flourish, and what I need to create substantial frameworks to control.</p>

              <h3>The Learning Style Method</h3>
              <img src="images\learning-styles1.png" alt="learning-styles-result1">
              <p>This result shows an even split between Theorist and Reflector styles of learning. A theorist tends to think through problems logically. A person who is suited to this learning style tends to prefer having foundational knowledge and theoretical basis to come to conclusions. In comparison, a reflector style of learning tends to rely on collection and analysis of information. This mix seems to work together well. Using a theoretical basis and collection analysis to come to conclusions lays a strong framework for learning and development. </p>
              <img src="images\learning-styles2.png" alt="learning-styles-result2">
              <p>This result does seem to quantify my understanding of how I learn. It is difficult for me to learn something without fully understanding it. It is not enough for me to know how to do a skill, I need to know why that how it is done, and how each variable can impact the final product.  Analysing variables and gaining deeper understanding using that theoretical basis as a foundation is the most effective way I have found to learn. Unfortunately, this can lead to difficulties learning or even attempting to start learning, as it becomes a larger endeavour than just knowing the surface level knowledge.</p>

              <h3>Interactive Leadership Style Assessment</h3>
              <h4>Transformative Leader</h4>
              <p>The transformative leadership style tends to involve high levels of curiosity and interpersonal development. Transformative leaders work well within teams and use effective communication skills to create group environments in which members thrive. They can understand when innovation is needed and work creatively to solve complex issues. Transformative leaders tend to take more risks to achieve goals and can be critical of even small issues that may impact these goals. </p>
              <p>I have worked within group environments for most of my adult life, which has resulted in an ability to work within all types of teams. The curiosity aspect of this style does help me understand why I am always looking to figure out new ways of doing things, despite others being content with the current process. This has caused some conflicts with leadership above me especially, as it is difficult for me to be satisfied with doing things a way I consider inferior.</p>

              <h3>Personal and Team Considerations</h3>
              <p>The results from these personality tests highlight aspects of my personality that can be both valuable and destructive. It is easy to focus on the positive attributes of these personalities, however it has to be understood that they are the ideal not the reality. Rather than a categorisation of my personality, these tests can be used to understand what I need to be constructing within my life to highlight my positive characteristics and control potential issues. Although empathy is an extremely useful trait, it has decidedly impacted both my professional and personal life. I have had to create strategies to alleviate the negative impacts of being emotionally sensitive. Similarly, my need for holistic understanding of subjects has often led to being too intimidated to start. I have very high standards for myself and my quality of work, but they are often unrealistic expectations which can lead to high amounts of self-criticism.</p>
              <p>When working within a team, these traits can give me a substantial advantage. I have worked within many groups in my life, and I have found my ability to empathise with others a benefit. However, I have also had difficulties addressing conflict in order to maintain harmony.
              Furthermore, although I work well within a team, I also need quite a lot of independence. Working with people takes more energy for me than working alone. The most important aspect of these results to consider when working in a team is that they are not a guarantee of success. Every team I work within will function differently and adapting my own strengths and weaknesses will be the challenge.
              </p>
              <p>Of course, I can approach forming a team by utilising this understanding. For example, although I am capable of working with most people, it would be detrimental to myself to work with people who are unable to regulate their own emotional responses. It is not always possible of course, but it is beneficial to work with people who have good communication skills.  As it is easy for me to self-criticise and hold unrealistic expectations for myself, I need to make sure I am not passing those expectations on to others. I also tend to need a larger amount of time to learn how to do something before I am able to work on it. Being able to communicate this effectively to a team and also develop a plan to make sure it doesn’t impact others is crucial. </p>
