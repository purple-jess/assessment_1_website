            <h3>Myer Briggs Test</h3>
            <h4>INFP-T - Mediator</h4>

            <p>INFP’s, or Mediators, can be categorised as creative, idealistic, empathetic and individualistic. People who fall within this category tend to have strong values and are highly empathetic. INFP’s are often drawn to creative pursuits that align with their values to feel fulfilled.</p>
            <img src="images\myer-briggs.png" alt="myer-briggs-result">
            <h5>Strengths and Weaknesses</h5>
            <p>INFP’s are most categorised by their ability to empathise with others. This leads to a larger ability to work with different types of people and maintain relationships. Also known as a Mediator, INFP’s are able to understand people’s motivations and feelings. On the other hand, this emotional sensitivity also leads to greater vulnerability. People with this personality type can be influenced by other’s emotions and take criticism personally. This can also lead to self-criticism and ignoring one’s own needs over others.</p>
            <p>Another strength of INFP’s is their strong sense of ideals. Mediators tend to feel passionate about their beliefs and are often drawn to careers that adhere to their own morality over more pragmatic choices. This has a downside in that it is difficult to work on things that they are not passionate about. INFP’s may feel unfulfilled if they do not have connection to the work they are doing. Furthermore, INFP’s tend to hold themselves and others to unrealistic standards. It can be difficult to match up to what an INFP thinks a person should be, even for them.</p>
            <p>Finally, INFP’s tend to fall on the creative spectrum. They tend to look at problems in unorthodox ways and come up with creative solutions. They tend to be interested in fields that allow creativity and individual expression. Unfortunately, this ability to think imaginatively can also hinder their focus. It can be difficult for people with the INFP personality to commit to ideas, or settle on simple ways of doing things. </p>
            <p>This personality type certainly resonates with my own understanding of myself. Although inherently a flawed system, this broad categorisation of my personality has articulated aspects of myself that I could not do so before. In particular, my own need to adhere to my values and connect with others. It is easier to focus on the complimentary parts of this personality type, however I have definitely struggled throughout life from lacking purpose and having high emotional sensitivity. This result gives me a frame of reference to understand how I can flourish, and what I need to create substantial frameworks to control.</p>

              <h3>The Learning Style Method</h3>

              <p>This result shows an even split between Theorist and Reflector styles of learning (Emtrain 2022). A theorist tends to think through problems logically. A person who is suited to this learning style tends to prefer having foundational knowledge and theoretical basis to come to conclusions. In comparison, a reflector style of learning tends to rely on collection and analysis of information. This mix seems to work together well. Using a theoretical basis and collection analysis to come to conclusions lays a strong framework for learning and development. </p>
