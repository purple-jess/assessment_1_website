          <h3>Coffee Filter</h3>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <div class="coffee">
            <img src="images\coffee.jpg" alt="coffee">
            <p>The project I have devised is a mobile application that can be used to collect, analyse, and filter data about coffee shops in a specific area. Users will be able to input different variables like type of coffee, price, and brands of milk for different cafes in the area. Users will then be able to search and filter surrounding coffee shops according to these variables. Coffee is something that many people enjoy on a daily basis and have specific preferences for. This app will allow users to find a café nearby that caters to their specific preferences without trying to figure it out via reviews or accessing each separate café website.</p>


              </div>
          <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>Coffee culture is deeply engrained in Australian society. A recent research report published by Mordor Intelligence showed that 4 out of 5 Australians spent money on coffee on a weekly basis. By 2021, the total revenue of the Australian coffee market had reached 5.84 billion USD and is only expected to grow. However, this market is also extremely competitive. Depending on the location, there may be hundreds of small coffee shops all offering relatively similar offerings. Finding a café that makes coffee according to one’s specific preferences can be a long and time-consuming process and often expensive.</p>
            <p>I have worked as a barista for nearly a decade in different coffee shops in different cities. Each one has approached your daily coffee differently. Whether it be the brand of coffee, the types of alternative milks, the cost of extras, or the average wait time, each coffee you buy will be different. Of course, if you drink coffee regularly you might already have a café that you prefer that caters to your preferences. But what if you’re in a different area or started a new job in another suburb? This application will allow users to quickly find cafes near them which cater to their preferred order.</p>

          <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>The initial plan for this application is an application accessible via mobile devices. It will take user-inputted data as well as business-inputted data to collect information about how a coffee shop makes their coffee differently. There are many variables that go into making coffee, many which the average consumer may not even know about. But something as simple as the brand of oat milk you like can have a significant impact on the end result and your experience.</p>
            <p>Users will be able to find cafes nearby and input information such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Brand of coffee</li>
              <li>Brand and variety of alternative milks</li>
              <li>Brand of chocolate drinks (including dietary requirements)</li>
              <li>Brand of chai drinks (including dietary requirements)</li>
              <li>Brands and flavours of teas</li>
              <li>Speciality coffee availability (e.g. Pour over, batch brew, cold brew, etc.)</li>
              <li>Price of each coffee and extras</li>
              <li>Additional ordering methods (e.g Skip, Ubereats, etc.)</li>
              <li>Other types of cold drinks available</li>
              <li>Takeaway and dine in availability</li>
              <li>Seating options</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, not all of this information will be known or accessible by the average consumer. Therefore, businesses will have the option to customise their own data. Having a mix of data input methods will allow for more efficient data collection and greater adoption of the application.</p>
            <p>Based on this data, users will then be able to search their surrounding area and filter the results according to their preferences. For example, a user may prefer drinking Alternative Dairy Co oat milk and will look for cafés in the area who stock it. This application may also be used to help users make informed decisions. Two cafés near each other may have similar offerings but the pricing may be different. It is not uncommon for smaller cafes to have little to no information on the internet, apart from a social media page with a few pictures. This application means users will be able to quickly see differences between coffee shop offerings with very little effort.</p>
            <p>This application will require users and businesses to create accounts in order to access and contribute to its services. At this point there is no designed revenue aspect to this application. The initial goal is to increase user and business adoption and incentivise usage, although there are potential revenue streams which could be implemented in the future such as ad services or premium commercial features.</p>
            <p>Other future features could include more complicated variables, like wait times during different times of the day, or added reviews by users. This application has room for development and expansion, as there are many other aspects of the customer experience that could be used to filter more effectively. </p>
          <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
            <p>Building this mobile application will be a large endeavour. I do not have any experience with app development and have only recently started learning programming languages. This means there will be a steep learning curve for each different piece of software I need to utilise. Therefore, I have chosen Flutter as my tool of choice as it provides extensive tutorials and documentation and can be used to create multi-platform applications. To do this I will be using Android Studio as the IDE with Flutter and Dart plugins. The preferred backend developer for Flutter is Firebase, which is another learning curve. I will need to integrate Google Maps and location services into the application using Google Play Services SDK. I will need at least one Android device to test the application, although having various multi-platform devices would be ideal. GitHub will also be used in order to collaborate with other team members effectively. </p>
          <h4>Skills required</h4>
            <p>In order to create this application, I will need to learn how to use each piece of software. Android Studio and Flutter are completely new to me. Luckily, they both have extensive documentation to teach users how to build apps. Dart is the main programming language used by Flutter which I will have to learn. I believe that building a basic level application and learning these skills will take a large amount of time but will ultimately be feasible. The most difficult issue I anticipate having is related to backend development as I have very little knowledge and experience. Having multiple users and data inputs means there needs to be a focus on data storage and security. Overall, it will be an ambitious endeavour, but it is feasible to create at least a very basic application.</p>
          <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>If this application is developed successfully, it will be extremely useful for regular coffee drinkers. Finding a coffee shop that caters to a user’s preferences without having to look at each separate café will provide a simple solution to common problem. Users who have travelled to a different area will easily be able to find the perfect fit for them. Furthermore, businesses will be able to provide more detailed information for customers with very little effort. It may even increase business’s customer base as this information becomes available. Overall, it will users to navigate an extremely massive industry and make informed consumer choices.  </p>
